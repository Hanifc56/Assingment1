                While Simple Programmer was originally created by founder John Sonmez to distill what he learned as a
                web developer into understandable content, today it is focused on helping software developers,
                programmers and other IT professionals improve their careers and their lives. This blog gets into the
                nitty-gritty of being a web developer and if you've wondered about something web development related,
                there''s a good chance they've written about it. Simple Programmer puts a fun spin on videos, keeping
                you
                engaged with humor while providing valuable content. They're constantly posting new articles - almost
                daily - so you'll never be bored.
